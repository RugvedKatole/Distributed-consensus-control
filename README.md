This project implemented multi-agent consensus for different robot dynamics and graphs. There is also an attempt to demonstrate a containment problem.

## Features
The code allows the selection of the initial conditions through GUI, after which the said consensus algorithms solve it to get the consensus.
An animation of the consensus is also created for visualization.
This repository contains 
First-order integrator dynamics
Second-order integrator dynamics
Unicycle dynamics
Bipartite
## How to run
Run the `main.m` file in the respective folder. 
It will ask for number of agent and then provide the initial locations of the agents by clicking on the plot window.
